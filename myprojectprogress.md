As of now I am still looking to work on a web project owned by the Web Technologies Group. During the regular semesters these projects are worked on by 5 or more people, so we usually use the blessed repository structure, where the project lead handles pull reqs to the project. However since I am the only person working on these projects for the semester and I oversee all the projects, I will probably commit directly to these repos.
